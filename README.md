## _Massively scalable_

By using autodiff, we can fit over 40,000 spectral lines simultaneously.

## _Rooted in physics_

We first clone a precomputed synthetic spectrum, such as PHOENIX, and then **transfer learn** with data.

## _Blazing fast with GPUs_

We achieve $>60 \times$ speedups with NVIDIA GPUs, so training takes minutes instead of hours.
