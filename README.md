Hybrid data/model-driven approach to astronomical echelle spectroscopy data built on PyTorch

## Interpolation

Interpolation is needed in order to fit for the radial velocity of an observed spectrum compared to a spectral template. Currently PyTorch has not implemented interpolation for irregularly specified input coordinates, though the PyTorch team is aware of the interest in this [Feature Request](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/1552).

Instead, we are using a third party solution for interpolation found here:  
https://github.com/aliutkus/torchinterp1d

So in order to run this code you must install and compile this custom package manually:

```python
git clone https://github.com/aliutkus/torchinterp1d.git
cd torchinterp1d
python setup.py develop
```
