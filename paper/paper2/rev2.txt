Line 423: The comparison in speed between between KORG and the PHEONIX generator is very helpful. However, line 426 then goes on to compare the parallelized version of the PHEONIX generator to the serial version of KORG, which I do not think is a fair comparison. In most realistic situations, a user would be able to run KORG using multiprocessing in a way that would see an effective 1/N_processes speedup on the serial times. I request that the manuscript either clarifies why parallel PHEONIX should be compared to serial KORG or remove lines 426-429.
- Good to know! Removed this comparison.

Paragraph starting on line 526 to the end of line 560, including Figure 8: The median Teff, logg, and [Fe/H] residual values are reported in the text, but they don't appear to agree (by eye) with the values shown in Figure 8. For example, I would not have guessed that the median of the logg or [Fe/H] residuals are 0 dex for Teff<7000K as mentioned in line 542. It could be because Figure 8 has averaged different (logg, [Fe/H]) pairs with the same Teff together and the median is quite different, but this is not explained in the figure caption or body of the text. I suggest that Figure 8 shows the results of individual tests (e.g. a line for each of the 10 logg,[Fe/H] pairs, with labels for those pairs) to make it clearer where the residual means, medians, and standard deviations quoted in the text come from. The lines currently shown in Figure 8 are still useful, but the caption should describe how the different (logg,[Fe/H]) pairs are combined to produce these lines (e.g. median or mean or weighted average).
- Specified that we used the average.
